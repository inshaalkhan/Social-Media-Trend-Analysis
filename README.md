# Social-Media-Trend-Analysis
Analyzed datasets to find the top 5 most popular content categories on social media. Our journey included data understanding, cleaning, modeling, analysis, and Power BI dashboard creation, culminating in a concise presentation to stakeholders.


This project delves into the realm of social media trend analysis, aimed at uncovering valuable insights from a diverse array of datasets. The primary objective was to identify the top 5 most popular categories of content for the dummy client.

Given access to 7 distinct datasets, Project journey commenced with meticulous Data Understanding. This involved comprehensively exploring the datasets to gain insights into their structures, variables, and unique characteristics.

Subsequently, Embarked on the crucial phase of Data Cleaning, where I meticulously addressed inconsistencies, errors, and missing values within the datasets. By ensuring data integrity and quality, I laid a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

The Data Modelling phase saw me employing advanced analytical techniques to extract meaningful patterns and trends from the datasets. 

Next, the Data Analysis stage involved in-depth examination and interpretation of the model outputs, uncovering actionable insights and trends. Through rigorous analysis, I identified the top 5 most popular categories of content, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

To visualize and communicate our findings effectively, I leveraged the power of Power BI to create an intuitive and interactive dashboard. This dynamic dashboard provided stakeholders with real-time access to key metrics, trends, and visualizations, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Finally, armed with compelling insights and visualizations, I embarked on the crucial task of Storytelling. Through a comprehensive presentation utilizing the Power BI dashboard and accompanying PowerPoint slides, I engaged stakeholders in a narrative-driven exploration of the data, elucidating key findings, trends, and actionable recommendations. The video clip of the presentation is attached in the repository.

In conclusion, Social Media Trend Analysis project exemplifies a holistic approach to deriving actionable insights from diverse datasets. By seamlessly integrating data understanding, cleaning, modeling, analysis, visualization, and storytelling, I empowered stakeholders to navigate the dynamic landscape of social media with confidence and foresight.
